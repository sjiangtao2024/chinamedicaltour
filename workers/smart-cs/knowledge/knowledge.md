## 4. PAYMENT METHODS FOR FOREIGNERS
- **Alipay & WeChat Pay:** The primary way to pay in China.
- **Why it's Essential:** China is a cashless society. You NEED these apps for daily life: taxis (DiDi), subway, street food, convenience stores, and coffee shops. Cash is often inconvenient (no change).
- **Setup:** Download app -> Sign up with foreign phone number -> Link Visa/Mastercard/Amex.
- **Fees:**
  - Transactions under 200 RMB: FREE.
  - Transactions over 200 RMB: 3% fee charged by the payment provider (not us).
  - **Limit:** Usually 50,000 RMB per transaction (verify with app).
- **Cash:** Accepted but inconvenient (finding change is hard).

## 5. SAFETY & SECURITY (Is China Safe?)
- **Verdict:** YES. China is statistically one of the safest countries in the world.
- **Crime:** Violent crime against foreigners is extremely rare. Petty theft is also uncommon due to ubiquitous surveillance and cashless payments.
- **Nighttime:** It is completely safe to walk alone at night in major cities like Beijing and Chengdu.
- **Medical Safety:** Our partner hospitals (301, PUMCH) meet international JCI or 3A standards, comparable to Mayo Clinic.
