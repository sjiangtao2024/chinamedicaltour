# Project Agent Instructions

## Required Reading (Before Any Work)

- Worktree protocol: `docs/ai-worktrees-protocol.md`
  - This is the single source of truth for Multi‑AI worktree rules.
  - Always follow the worktree rules for this repo and `new-cmt`.

## Notes

- Front-end work must use the `new-cmt` repo and its worktrees.
- If these rules conflict with other docs, treat the worktree protocol as authoritative.
